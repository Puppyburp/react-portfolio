              on the Run International in Charlotte, North Carolina.

              I grew up in Rhode Island and have also had the pleasure of living
              in New York City and Connecticut. I currently call North Carolina
              home and spend as much time as I can traveling the world. When not
              earning American Airlines miles, you'll find me snuggling my wild
              Goldendoodle, Fozzie and silky gray cat, Maddie.
